Powered by [Rock the JVM!](rockthejvm.com)

This repository contains the code we wrote during [Rock the JVM's Akka Essentials with Scala](https://rockthejvm.com/course/akka-essentials) course. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-general-recap`
* `1.2-advanced-recap`
* `1.3-multithreading-recap`
* `1.4-thread-model-limitations`
* `2.2-actors-intro`
* `2.3-actor-capabilitites`
* `2.4-actors-exercises`
* `2.6-changing-actor-behavior`
* `2.8-changing-behavior-exercise`
* `2.9-child-actors`
* `2.10-child-actors-exercise`
* `2.11-actor-logging`
* `2.12-config`
* `3.1-testkit-intro`
* `3.2-testprobes`
* `3.3-timed-assertions`
* `3.4-intercepting-logs`
* `3.5-synchronous-testing`
* `4.1-starting-stopping-actors`
* `4.2-actor-lifecycle`
* `4.3-supervision`
* `4.4-backoff-supervisor`
* `5.1-timers-schedulers`
* `5.2-routers`
* `5.3-dispatchers`
* `5.4-mailboxes`
* `6.1-stash`
* `6.2-ask`
* `6.3-fsm`
* `6.4-fsm-part-2`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
